## My process


### Built with


- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned


While building this component, I learned:
- How to structure HTML semantically using `<article>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`
- How `width: 100%` only works when the parent has a set width
- How to deal with SVGs or images that have internal padding by cropping or replacing them
- How to troubleshoot layout issues by comparing with working solutions


Here’s a CSS snippet I’m proud of:

```css
.card-image img{
    border-radius: 20px;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
   
}
```



### Continued development


I’d like to keep improving my CSS layout skills and get more comfortable with responsive design, particularly using grid and clamp() for fluid spacing and typography.
